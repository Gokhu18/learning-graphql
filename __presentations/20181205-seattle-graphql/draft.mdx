# What will we need?

<ul style={{listStyle: 'none'}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>A back-end MongoDB database server</li>
    <li>A back-end server for GraphQL and other APIs</li>
    <li>A simple web application to use our GraphQL API</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
For this demo, there are three things that we are going to need.
```

# What would be a bonus?

<ul style={{listStyle: 'none'}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>Lightweight tools to explore our GraphQL API</li>
    <li>Multiple front-end applications using our GraphQL</li>
    <li>The ability to use GitHub to sign in and out of a sample application</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
Let's consider three things that might be nice to have.
```

# Good news!
## We can do it all.

    <li>Create an easy to spin up environment that can be destroyed & recreated as desired</li>

# What are we working with?

---
# Virtual machines
"Virtual machines (VMs) are an abstraction of physical hardware turning one server into many servers. 

Each VM includes a full copy of an operating system, the application, necessary binaries and libraries - taking up tens of GBs. VMs can also be slow to boot."

[https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)

```notes
One approach might be to use virtual machines for our application.
```

---
<Image src='./images/virtual-machines-each-with-an-individual-app.png' size='50%' />

```notes
We could have multiple machines or virtual machines that run these apps/services individually...

How might we scale this? We could add more virtual machines if our back-end server is being hammered; ditto for other services.

As you might imagine, not only is this expensive but it introduces all kinds of room for error. One person might be working on the front-end app and it's good. Someone else is working on the back-end. While "it works fine for me" is true in both cases, something is slightly off in production and bam - the project is broken, and both people see working code.
```

# VMs have their place

<ul style={{listStyle: 'none'}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>...but what if we used Docker and containerized our apps/services?</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

```notes
VMs definitely have their place.

::press the arrow key::

...but what if we used Docker and containerized our apps/services?
```

---
# These look like containers.
![](./images/what-are-we-working-with.png)

```notes
Aha! We have four discrete ideas for each app/service we want to work with.

With Docker, we can have our apps/services existing as separate containers (instances of an image - which is merely a recipe for creating the app or service)
```
---
# Docker: Container
"A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings."

[https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)

```notes
Imagine a case where we have several apps - one that may be a NodeJS app running under Node.js v8.x, a Node.js v10.x app, a legacy lightweight service that might be running on an unsupported version of Node.js v4.x...We're not reliant upon the host to have a specific version of Node.js installed. Each container is built and contains everything it needs to run as a standalone process...or a case where our architecture is ready to support scaling such that we have two containers for each front-end app, three containers for the back-end API, and maybe five MongoDB services in a cluster.

If we thought of each container as AppA, AppB, AppC, AppD, etc...

That's a quick overview of Docker. For more information, you can check out this link.

Now that we have an understanding of how we might use Docker, let's see how this will apply to our current project.

# Initial front-end application setup
This project contains two front-end applications

`photo-share-client` and `nextjs-with-apollo`

photo-share-client is the project created as part of following along with the Learning GraphQL book.

nextjs-with-apollo is the project I created to explore NextJS and GraphQL.

## Your ticket to exploration

```notes
Let's use the freely available Kitematic app to explore images that are on Docker Hub.
```

<Image src='./images/kitematic.png' />

```notes
Whoa. Pretty freakin' cool, huh?

Instead of worrying about defining a Dockerfile for our MongoDB, let's use an existing image instead...
```

# How would I use an image?
