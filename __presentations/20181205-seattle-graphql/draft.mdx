# Let's get started
All code in this presentation is available at [https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/learning-graphql](https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/learning-graphql)

---
# What will we need?

<ul style={{listStyle: 'none'}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>A back-end MongoDB database server</li>
    <li>A back-end server for GraphQL and other APIs</li>
    <li>A simple web application to use our GraphQL API</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---
# What would be a bonus?

<ul style={{listStyle: 'none'}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>Lightweight tools to explore our GraphQL API</li>
    <li>Multiple front-end applications using our GraphQL</li>
    <li>The ability to use GitHub to sign in and out of our application</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---
# Good news!
## We can do it all.

---
# Our goal
<ul style={{listStyle: 'none'}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>Create an easy to spin up environment for GraphQL</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

+ Getting started
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
    + What is Docker?
    + Why Docker?
    + Architecture
    + Docker containers    
      - `graphql-mongodb`
      - `graphql-api`
      - `graphql-web`
      - `graphql-nextjs`
+ Project structure
  - `docker-compose.yml`
    + High level recipe for creating our services
      - MongoDB is using an image from Mongo
      - Our back-end and front-end apps all refer to `Dockerfile.dev` and other configuration
    + First, look at this file from the bottom up
    + Look at how the back-end API is configured and dependent upon mongodb
    + Look at how both front-end applications depend on the back-end API
  - Before starting this project, you will need to create two `.env` files - one in `./photo-share-api` and one in `./photo-share-client`.
+ Initial project setup & configuration
  - GitHub setup & configuration
    + Please go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) to create a new [OAuth Application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) with the following settings:
      - Application name - Whatever you want
      - Homepage URL - [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
      - Authorization callback URL - [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
    + Be sure to note the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` values.
+ Spin up the Docker environment
  - Look at the scripts in `package.json`
+ GraphQL
  - `photo-share-api/index.js` - Back-end API (GraphQL, etc)
+ Explore
  - [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
  - [GraphQL playground](http://localhost:4000/playground)
