# The Road to GraphQL

[![](https://www.robinwieruch.de/img/posts/the-road-to-graphql-book/banner_1024.jpg)](https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-road-to-graphql-book/)

---
# Let's get started
All code in this presentation is available at [https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/learning-graphql](https://github.com/TheRobBrennan/learning-graphql)

---
# What will we need?

<ul style={{listStyle: 'none'}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>A back-end MongoDB database server</li>
    <li>A back-end server for GraphQL and other APIs</li>
    <li>A simple web application to use our GraphQL API</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---
# What would be a bonus?

<ul style={{listStyle: 'none'}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>Lightweight tools to explore our GraphQL API</li>
    <li>Multiple front-end applications using our GraphQL</li>
    <li>The ability to use GitHub to sign in and out of our application</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---
# Good news!
## We can do it all.

---
# Our goal
<ul style={{listStyle: 'none'}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>Create an easy to spin up environment for GraphQL</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

# What are we working with?

# Virtual machines
"Virtual machines (VMs) are an abstraction of physical hardware turning one server into many servers. 

Each VM includes a full copy of an operating system, the application, necessary binaries and libraries - taking up tens of GBs. VMs can also be slow to boot."

[https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)

```notes
One approach might be to use virtual machines for our application.
```

---
<Image src='./images/virtual-machines-each-with-an-individual-app.png' size='50%' />

```notes
We could have multiple machines or virtual machines that run these apps/services individually...

How might we scale this? We could add more virtual machines if our back-end server is being hammered; ditto for other services.

As you might imagine, not only is this expensive but it introduces all kinds of room for error. One person might be working on the front-end app and it's good. Someone else is working on the back-end. While "it works fine for me" is true in both cases, something is slightly off in production and bam - the project is broken, and both people see working code.
```

---
# VMs have their place

<ul style={{listStyle: 'none'}}>
  <Appear>
    <li>...but what if we used Docker and containerized our apps/services?</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---
# Remember?
![](./images/what-are-we-working-with.png)

```notes
Aha! We have four discrete apps/services we want to work with. Imagine we named each container AppA, AppB, AppC, AppD, etc...
```
---
<Image src='./images/docker-containerized-applictions.png' size='60%' />

```notes
What is a container, exactly?
```
---
# Docker
"A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings."

[https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)

```notes
With Docker, we can have our apps/services existing as separate containers (instances of an image - which is merely a recipe for creating the app or service)

How might we be able to scale our solution?

We can have one host - a laptop, a server in the cloud, multiple servers appearing to act as a single host, etc - and define as many containers as we want. Imagine a case where our architecture is ready to support scaling such that we have two containers for each front-end app, three containers for the back-end API, and maybe five MongoDB services in a cluster.

# Initial front-end application setup
This project contains two front-end applications

`photo-share-client` and `nextjs-with-apollo`

```notes
photo-share-client is the project created for the Learning GraphQL book.

nextjs-with-apollo is the project I created to explore NextJS and GraphQL.

Wait. We built the application, and we're still starting it in development mode?

Hang in there. You'll see why shortly.
